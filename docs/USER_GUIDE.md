- **Use consistent formatting**: "Feature: Add dark mode" vs "Add dark mode"

#### Priority Guidelines

- **Urgent**: System down, security issues, critical bugs
- **High**: Important features, major bugs, deadlines
- **Medium**: Regular features, minor bugs, improvements
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, refactoring, documentation

#### Due Date Strategy

- **Set realistic due dates** based on estimated hours
- **Use due dates for external deadlines** (client requests, releases)
- **Don't set due dates for exploratory tasks**

### Workflow Optimization

#### Board Usage

1. **Backlog**: Brain dump all ideas and requests
2. **To Do**: Plan your work for the day/week
3. **In Progress**: Focus on one task at a time (WIP limit)
4. **Done**: Review completed work before auto-cleanup

#### Daily Routine

1. **Morning**: Review "To Do" board, move tasks to "In Progress"
2. **During work**: Focus on "In Progress" tasks
3. **End of day**: Move completed tasks to "Done"
4. **Weekly**: Review "Backlog" and plan next week

#### Tag Strategy

- **Use consistent tags** across similar tasks
- **Create tag combinations**: "frontend + urgent" for critical UI issues
- **Don't over-tag**: 2-3 tags per task maximum

### Productivity Tips

#### Focus Techniques

- **Respect WIP limits**: Don't start new tasks until current ones are done
- **Use filters**: Focus on "Today" or "This Week" tasks
- **Batch similar tasks**: Group "frontend" or "backend" tasks together

#### Time Management
